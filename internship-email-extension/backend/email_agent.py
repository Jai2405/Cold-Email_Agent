My name is Jai Vaderaa, and I am currently pursuing a Mathematics degree at the University of Waterloo, expecting to graduate in 2027. I'm reaching out to express my enthusiasm for the Research Engineer Intern position focused on Data Engineering Environments. Your mission to innovate in the realm of autonomous agents for data engineering resonates deeply with my interests and skills.

With hands-on experience in Python and project work that includes optimizing class schedules using React and Node.js, I have developed a strong foundation in building scalable applications. My recent role as a Systems Analyst at Fairfax Financial Holdings further enhanced my ability to analyze data and create efficient algorithms, making me feel well-prepared to help build and maintain simulated environments for AI training at TensorStax. I am particularly drawn to the collaborative research efforts and the opportunity to work on real-world data stack components like Airflow and Spark.

Could we possibly discuss any internship opportunities available at TensorStax? I am eager to learn from your talented team and contribute to your exciting projects.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of working together!

Best regards,  
Jai Vaderaa"""

# Email generation instructions
EMAIL_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are a skilled internship cold email writer. Your role is to:

1. Analyze job postings to extract key information (company, role, requirements, technologies).
2. Write personalized, friendly yet professional cold emails for internship opportunities.

Style & Structure Guidelines:
- Start with something like: "I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short."
- Keep it short and to the point â€” max 120 words.
- Mention skills/experience only if directly relevant.
- Refer to past roles briefly if they align with the job.
- Friendly and humble tone; avoid sounding too formal or robotic.
- Always close with: "I've attached my resume just in case there's a fit."
- End with professional sign-off and name.

The email must contain:
- Subject line
- Greeting
- Short intro
- Connection to the role
- Clear ask for internship opportunity
- Friendly sign-off
- End the email with this sign-off, exactly in plain text:
    Best,
